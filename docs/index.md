 - Cool UI animations where fitting and possible
 - Refactor GUI code into `Companion` namespace(s)
 - (Draw section) Add base for tools (Pen, highlighter ..etc..)
 - (AI Section) Add base for object recognition
 - - Auto categorize screenshots in folders (Each object in its folder)
 - (AI section) Add base for text detection (OCR)

 - (And a lot more stuff)

### ü™≤ Known bugs:
 - (Sometimes) Double extensions while saving screenshot locally
 - (Rare) Corrupt memory / Reading-Writing to illegal memory space which causes ScreenFIRE to crash completely
 - (Wayland) Screenshot produces black images
 - (Wayland) `Window`s have black backgrounds instead of transparency
 - (Wayland) Toolbox ignores `Move` commands sent from other `Window`s
 - [FIXED] ~~Toolbox might be sent to behind the main window (which makes ScreenFIRE unusable)~~
 - [FIXED] ~~Toolbox background might get squashed down from its normal size sometimes~~
 - [FIXED] ~~(User misbehavior) Capturing wrong area when the user forcefully moves ScreenFIRE window~~
