 - Monitors detection including various functions
 - Screenshot base
 - Screenshot interface
 - Screenshot toolbox (Floating buttons and options)
 - Base of adding shapes and text to the screenshot (Rectangle, Rounded rectangle, Circle, Ellipse)
 - Moderate configuration window (Currently contains default actions options .etc..)
 - Save the screenshot (and avoid file collisions)
 - Save the screenshot to clipboard
 - (And a lot of stuff)

### ‚è≥ Pending:

 - (Effects section) filters for sreenshot (tinting, white balance. Etc.)
 - (Effects section) blur/pixelate effect for screenshot (ex: blur sensitive area of screenshot)
 - Cool UI animations where fitting and possible
 - Refactor GUI code into `Companion` namespace(s)
 - (Draw section) Add base for tools (Pen, highlighter ..etc..)
 - (AI Section) Add base for object recognition
 - - Auto categorize screenshots in folders (Each object in its folder)

### ü™≤ Known bugs:
 - (Sometimes) Double extensions while saving screenshot locally
 - (Rare) Corrupt memory / Reading-Writing to illegal memory space which causes ScreenFIRE to crash completely
 - [FIXED] ~~Toolbox might be sent to behind the main window (which makes ScreenFIRE unusable)~~
 - [FIXED] ~~Toolbox background might get squashed down from its normal size sometimes~~
 - [FIXED] ~~(User misbehavior) Capturing wrong area when the user forcefully moves ScreenFIRE window~~
