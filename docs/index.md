Sophisticated screenshot utility for Linux and Windows!
<br/><br/><br/>

## üëÅÔ∏è Note: Repository is currently private.

## Status:
 - ScreenFIRE is currently in the development phase.
 - It is not far from the first alpha release!

### ‚úîÔ∏è Done:
 - Support for both Windows and Linux
 - Screenshot interface
 - Screenshot toolbox GUI (Floating buttons and options)
 - Base of adding shapes and text to the screenshot (Rectangle, Rounded rectangle, Circle, Ellipse)
 - Moderate configuration window (Currently contains default actions options .etc..)
 - Save the screenshot (and avoid file collisions)
 - Save the screenshot to clipboard
 - (And a lot of stuff)

### ‚è≥ Pending:
 - Add shapes to the screenshot
 - - Add base for more shapes (Like triangle, star, speach bubble...)
 - Add text to the screenshot
 - Add custom shaped screenshots (With transparency)
 - Upload the screenshot to various websites (Like imgur...)
 - Record gif and videos
 - Global shortcuts support (Custom shortcuts for custom actions)
 - Homemade icons (Nice & clean icons instead of the default gtk icons)
 - (And a lot more stuff)

### ü™≤ Known bugs:
 - (Sometimes) Double extensions while saving screenshot locally
 - (Fixed) ~~Toolbox background might get squashed down from its normal size sometimes~~
 - (Fixed)(User misbehavior) ~~Capturing at a wrong position when ScreenFIRE is forcefully moved out of its programmed position (0,0)~~
 - (Rare) Corrupt memory / Reading-Writing to illegal memory space which causes ScreenFIRE to crash completely
